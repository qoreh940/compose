# compose
A practice project to explore and master Jetpack Compose components and patterns. 
I just want to make a template for me. This is what I made this project.

# The composable features provided by Android I used
- Navigation (NavHost, NavController)
- Scaffold (TopAppBar, content)
- LazyColumn, OutlinedCard
- Button (Button, FilledTonalButton, OutlinedButton, ElevatedButton, IconButton, Card width expandable Button and Custom )
